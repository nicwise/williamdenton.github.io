I've spent the evening setting up the template for this blog and tweaking all the little things that have little effect on what you actually read here. The perfect developers procrastination.

It covers off a few firsts for me:

* Forking on github (thanks to [Rosario][github-fork] and the work they put into the theme).
* Creating a blog (with the intention of updating it semi-regularly).
* Trying out Microsofts [Code][ms-code] editor (and discovering it's just a clone of [Atom][atom] and [Brackets][brackets]).

The site is hosted on [Git Hub Pages][github-pages] and is written in a mixture of html and markdown. I've been wanting to try out [Jekyll][jekyll] as a blogging platform for a while. I've tinkered before but never used it in anger. I like the idea of writing in markdown so this is a natural fit.
