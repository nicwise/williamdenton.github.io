title: About William Denton 
---

I'm a software developer living in Auckland, New Zealand. I've been building software using dotnet since 2005. I help teams build out micro-services on AWS using dotnet core. I enjoy working on tooling and improving the developer experience so teams can get started quickly and focus on whats important.
